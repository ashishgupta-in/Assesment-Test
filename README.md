# 1. C++ Dictionary Problem

Trie implementation to store the dictionary along with Hash Map to store the children of a node.
Memory is allocated only for the alphabets and for the frequencies.

The words of the dictionary are case-sensitive. 
Keyboard is not same as keyboard or vice-versa.

The program will read the csv format dictionary file and create a trie.
The output for a particular word input if it is present in the dictionary will be "Yes, #frequency". Otherwise, "No".  
  
  
Example -  
Input: zoo  
Output: Yes, 127  
  
Input: Rahul  
Output: No  


# 2. Front End Sign Up Form with Google API Integration

The materialize front-end framework has been used for the layout, available on https://materializecss.com/  
On the Google API Console a demo project and web credentials has been created for implementing google sign-in function and getting the user credentials.  
The google sign-in and sign-out has been added to the form.  
Also, the basic sign-up and sign-out has been added to the form.  
  
One has to create a local web server running on port 8000 (as http://localhost:800 has been added for the authorized URI of the web application on the google console).  
Simple way to do through Command Prompt : python -m http.server 8000
