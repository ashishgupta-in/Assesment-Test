# 1. C++ Dictionary Problem

Trie implementation to store the dictionary along with Hash Map to store the children of a node.
Memory is allocated only for the alphabets and for the frequencies.

The words of the dictionary are case-sensitive. 
Keyboard is not same as keyboard or vice-versa.

The program will read the csv format dictionary file and create a trie.
The output for a particular word input if it is present in the dictionary will be "Yes, #frequency". Otherwise, "No".  
  
  
Example -  
Input: zoo  
Output: Yes, 127  
  
Input: Rahul  
Output: No
